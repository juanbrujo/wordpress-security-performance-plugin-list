This is a list of my must-have WordPress plugins focused in the security of the platform.

- [All In One WP Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/)
- [Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/)
- [WordPress Firewall 2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-firewall-2/)

The only one needed to better handle cache:

- [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)
